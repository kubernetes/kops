## Release notes for kops 1.19 series

(The kops 1.19 release has not been released yet; this is a document to gather the notes prior to the release).

# Significant changes

## Changes to kubernetes config export

Kops will no longer automatically export the kubernetes config on `kops update cluster`. In order to export the config on cluster update, you need to either add the `--user <user>` to reference an existing user, or `--admin` to export the cluster admin user. If neither flag is passed, the kubernetes config will not be modified. This makes it easier to reuse user definitions across clusters should you, for example, use OIDC for authentication.

Similarly, `kops export kubecfg` will also require passing either the `--admin` or `--user` flag if the context does not already exist.

By default, the credentials of any exported admin user now have a lifetime of 18 hours. The lifetime of the exported
credentials may be specified as a value of the `--admin` flag. To get the previous behavior, specify `--admin=87600h` to either `kops update cluster` or `kops export kubecfg`.

`kops create cluster --yes` exports the admin user along with rest of the cluster config, as was the previous behaviour (except for the 18-hour validity).

## OpenStack Cinder plugin

Kops will install the Cinder plugin for kops running kubernetes 1.16 or newer. If you already have this plugin installed you should remove it before upgrading.

If you already have a default `StorageClass`, you should set `cloudConfig.Openstack.BlockStorage.CreateStorageClass: false` to prevent kops from installing one.

## Other significant changes by kind

### General

* New clusters will now have one nodes group per zone. The number of nodes now defaults to the number of zones.

* On AWS kops now defaults to using launch templates instead of launch configurations.

* There is now Alpha support for Hashicorp Vault as a store for secrets and keys. See the [Vault state store docs](/state/#vault-vault).

* The lifetimes of certificates used by various components have been substantially reduced.
The certificates on a node will expire sometime between 455 and 485 days after the node's creation.
The expiration times vary randomly so that nodes are likely to have their certs expire at different times than other nodes.

### CLI

* The `kops update cluster` command will now refuse to run on a cluster that
has been updated by a newer version of kops unless it is given the `--allow-kops-downgrade` flag.

* New command for deleting a single instance: [kops delete instance](/docs/cli/kops_delete_instance/)

### CNI

* Clusters using the Amazon VPC CNI provider now perform an `ec2.DescribeInstanceTypes` call at instance launch time. In large clusters or AWS accounts this may lead to API throttling which could delay node readiness. If this becomes a problem please open a GitHub issue.

* Clusters using Calico with `CrossSubnet` enabled will switch to the new [awsSrcDstCheck](https://docs.projectcalico.org/reference/resources/felixconfig#spec) for disabling the [AWS source/destination checks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html#EIP_Disable_SrcDestCheck). The previous implementation using [k8s-ec2-srcdst](https://github.com/ottoyiu/k8s-ec2-srcdst) is now deprecated.

* Clusters using Calico can now enable the [eBPF dataplane](https://docs.projectcalico.org/about/about-ebpf) mode for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) hosts. Add `spec.networking.calico.bpfEnabled: true` and `spec.kubeProxy.enabled: false` to the cluster spec to enable.

* Clusters using Calico can now encrypt pod-to-pod traffic with [WireGuard](https://docs.projectcalico.org/security/encrypt-cluster-pod-traffic) for Ubuntu hosts. Add `spec.networking.calico.wireguardEnabled: true` to the cluster spec to enable.

* New clusters running Cilium now enable BPF NodePort by default if the Kubernetes version is 1.12 or newer.

### Addons

* Metrics Server is now available as a configurable addon. Add `spec.metricsServer.enabled: true` to the cluster spec to enable.

* Cluster Autoscaler is now availalble as a configurable addon. Add `spec.clusterAutoscaler.enabled: true` to the cluster spec to enable.

* AWS Node Termination Handler is now available as a configurable addon. Add `spec.nodeTerminationHandler.enabled: true` to the cluster spec to enable.

# Breaking changes

* Support for Kubernetes 1.9 and 1.10 has been removed.

* Support for the Romana networking provider has been removed.

* Support for legacy IAM permissions has been removed. This removal may be temporarily deferred to kops 1.20 by setting the `LegacyIAM` feature flag.

# Required Actions

* See note about [Openstack Cinder plugin](#openstack-cinder-plugin) above.

* Terraform users, in order to prevent downtime you will have to remove the state of the existing ELB attatchments from your terraform state file. This is due to us migrating to setting the loadbalancer attatchment when defining the ASG resource. The migration was required due to a bug described in #9913.

To prevent downtime, follow these steps with the new version of Kops:
  ```
  kops update cluster --target terraform ...
  terraform plan
  terraform state list | grep aws_autoscaling_attachment | xargs -L1 terraform state rm
  terraform plan
  # Ensure these resources are no longer being destroyed and recreated
  terraform apply
  ```

* If you are using Terraform with an additional .tf file and using "aws_autoscaling_attachment" to attach additional Load Balancers or ALB/NLB Target Groups you'll need to migrate to [attaching them through the InstanceGroup spec instead](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/instance_groups/#externalloadbalancers).

# Deprecations

* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.11 and 1.12 are deprecated and will be removed in kops 1.20.

* Support for Terraform version 0.11 has been deprecated and will be removed in kops 1.20.

* Support for feature flag `Terraform-0.12` has been deprecated and will be removed in kops 1.20. All generated Terraform HCL2/JSON files will support versions `0.12.26+` and `0.13.0+`.

* The [manifest based metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.

* The [manifest based cluster autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.
