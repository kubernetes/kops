## Release notes for kops 1.18 series

(The kops 1.18 release has not been released yet; this is a document to gather the notes prior to the release).

# Significant changes

* The default Docker version has been changed to 19.03.8.

* Support for [RHEL 8](../operations/images.md#rhel-8) and [CentOS 8](../operations/images.md#centos-8) has been added.

* Support for Amazon Linux 2 has been improved and will work with the default Docker version.

* [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/README.md) has been added and can be selected as an alternate container runtime for Kubernetes. Enable by using the `--container-runtime containerd` flag when creating a cluster or by setting `spec.containerRuntime: containerd`.

* Rolling updates now support surging and parallelism within an instance group. For details see [the documentation](../operations/rolling-update.md).

* Cilium CNI can now use AWS networking natively through the AWS ENI IPAM mode. Kops can also run a Kubernetes cluster entirely without kube-proxy using Cilium's BPF NodePort implementation.

* Cilium CNI can now use a dedicated etcd cluster managed by etcd-manager for synchronizing agent state instead of CRDs.

* The Terraform target now supports Terraform 0.12 syntax (HCL2) by default. See the Required Actions item below.

* New clusters in GCE are configured to run the [metadata-proxy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/metadata-proxy) by default. The proxy runs as a DaemonSet and lands on nodes with the nodeLabel `cloud.google.com/metadata-proxy-ready: "true"`. If you want to enable metadata-proxy on an existing cluster/instance group, add that nodeLabel to your instancegroup specs (`kops edit ig ...`) and run `kops update cluster`. When the changes are applied, the proxy will roll out to those targeted nodes.

* GCE has a new flag: `--gce-service-account`. This takes the email of an existing GCP service account and launches the instances with it. This setting applies to the whole cluster (ie: it is not currently designed to support Instance Groups with different service accounts). If you do not specify a service account during cluster creation, the default compute service account will be used which matches the prior behavior.

* Google API client libraries updated from v0.beta to v1.

# Breaking changes

* Support for Docker versions 1.11, 1.12 and 1.13 has been removed because of the [dockerproject.org shut down](https://www.docker.com/blog/changes-dockerproject-org-apt-yum-repositories/). Those affected must upgrade to a newer Docker version.

* Terraform users on AWS may need to rename some resources in their state file in order to prepare for Terraform 0.12 support. See Required Actions below.

* The Docker `health-check` service is now disabled by default. It shouldn't be needed anymore, but it can still be enabled by setting `spec.docker.healthCheck: true`. It is recommended to also check [node-problem-detector](https://github.com/kubernetes/node-problem-detector) and [draino](https://github.com/planetlabs/draino) as replacements. See Required Actions below.

* Lyft CNI plugin default subnet tags changed from from `Type: pod` to `KubernetesCluster: myclustername.mydns.io`. Subnets intended for use by the plugin will need to be tagged with this new tag and [additional tag filters](https://github.com/lyft/cni-ipvlan-vpc-k8s#other-configuration-flags) may need to be added to the cluster spec in order to achieve the desired set of subnets.

* Support for basic authentication has been disabled by default and will be [removed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/89069) in Kubernetes 1.19.

* Support for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.9 has been removed.

* Kubernetes 1.9 users will need to enable the PodPriority feature gate. See Required Actions below.

* A controller is now used to apply labels to nodes.  If you are not using AWS, GCE or OpenStack your (non-master) nodes may not have labels applied correctly.

* The `kops/v1alpha1` API has been removed. Users of `kops replace` will need to supply v1alpha2 resources.

* Please see the notes in the 1.15 release about the apiGroup changing from kops to kops.k8s.io

# Required Actions

* Terraform users on AWS may need to rename resources in their terraform state file in order to support Terraform 0.12.
  Terraform 0.12 [no longer supports resource names starting with digits](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-12.html#pre-upgrade-checklist). In Kops, both the default route and additional VPC CIDR associations are affected. See [#7957](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/7957) for more information.
  * The default route was named `aws_route.0-0-0-0--0` and will now be named `aws_route.route-0-0-0-0--0`.
  * Additional CIDR blocks associated with a VPC were similarly named the hyphenated CIDR block with two hyphens for the `/`, for example `aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.10-1-0-0--16`. These will now be prefixed with `cidr-`, for example `aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.cidr-10-1-0-0--16`.

  To prevent downtime, follow these steps with the new version of Kops:
  ```
  KOPS_FEATURE_FLAG=-Terraform-0.12 kops update cluster --target terraform ...
  # Use Terraform <0.12
  terraform plan
  # Observe any aws_route or aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association resources being destroyed and recreated
  # Run these commands as necessary. The exact names may differ; use what is outputted by terraform plan
  terraform state mv aws_route.0-0-0-0--0 aws_route.route-0-0-0-0--0
  terraform state mv aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.10-1-0-0--16 aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association.cidr-10-1-0-0--16
  terraform plan
  # Ensure these resources are no longer being destroyed and recreated
  terraform apply
  ```
  Kops will now output Terraform 0.12 syntax with the normal workflow:
  ```
  kops update cluster --target terraform ...
  # Use Terraform 0.12. This plan should be a no-op
  terraform plan
  ```

* Users that need the Docker `health-check` service will need to explicitly enable it:
```
  kops edit cluster
  # Add the following section
  spec:
    docker:
      healthCheck: true
  ```

* Kubernetes 1.9 users will need to enable the PodPriority feature gate. This is required for newer versions of Kops.

  To enable the Pod priority feature, follow these steps:
  ```
  kops edit cluster
  # Add the following section
  spec:
    kubelet:
      featureGates:
        PodPriority: "true"
  ```

* If a custom Kops build was used on a cluster, a kops-controller Deployment may have been created that should get deleted.
  Run `kubectl -n kube-system delete deployment kops-controller` after upgrading to Kops 1.16.0-beta.1 or later.

# Deprecations

* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.9 and 1.10 are deprecated and will be removed in kops 1.19.
