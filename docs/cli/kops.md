## kops

kOps is Kubernetes Operations.

### Synopsis

kOps is Kubernetes Operations.

 kOps is the easiest way to get a production grade Kubernetes cluster up and running. We like to think of it as kubectl for clusters.

 kOps helps you create, destroy, upgrade and maintain production-grade, highly available, Kubernetes clusters from the command line. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is currently officially supported, with Digital Ocean and OpenStack in beta support.

### Options

```
      --config string   yaml config file (default is $HOME/.kops.yaml)
  -h, --help            help for kops
      --name string     Name of cluster. Overrides KOPS_CLUSTER_NAME environment variable
      --state string    Location of state storage (kops 'config' file). Overrides KOPS_STATE_STORE environment variable
  -v, --v Level         number for the log level verbosity
```
