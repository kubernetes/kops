                        Valid families include: al2, al2023, bottlerocket, windows2019, and windows2022.
                        The version can either be pinned to a specific AMI release, with that AMIs version format (ex: "al2023@v20240625" or "bottlerocket@v1.10.0").
                        The version can also be set to "latest" for any family. Setting the version to latest will result in drift when a new AMI is released. This is **not** recommended for production environments.
                        Note: The Windows families do **not** support version pinning, and only latest may be used.

                            IOPS is the number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3, io1, and io2 volumes,

                            rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

                            The following are the supported values for each volume type:

                            For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for Instances built
                            on the Nitro System (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances).
                            Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                            This parameter is supported for io1, io2, and gp3 volumes only. This parameter
                            is not supported for gp2, st1, sc1, or standard volumes.

                  StartupTaints are taints that are applied to nodes upon startup which are expected to be removed automatically
                  within a short period of time, typically by a DaemonSet that tolerates the taint. These are commonly used by
                  daemonsets to allow initialization and enforce startup ordering.  StartupTaints are ignored for provisioning
                  purposes in that pods are not required to tolerate a StartupTaint in order to have nodes provisioned for them.

                  TerminationGracePeriod is the maximum duration the controller will wait before forcefully deleting the pods on a node, measured from when deletion is first initiated.

                  Warning: this feature takes precedence over a Pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds value, and bypasses any blocked PDBs or the karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt annotation.

                  This field is intended to be used by cluster administrators to enforce that nodes can be cycled within a given time period.
                  When set, drifted nodes will begin draining even if there are pods blocking eviction. Draining will respect PDBs and the do-not-disrupt annotation until the TGP is reached.

                  Karpenter will preemptively delete pods so their terminationGracePeriodSeconds align with the node's terminationGracePeriod.
                  If a pod would be terminated without being granted its full terminationGracePeriodSeconds prior to the node timeout,
                  that pod will be deleted at T = node timeout - pod terminationGracePeriodSeconds.

                  The feature can also be used to allow maximum time limits for long-running jobs which can delay node termination with preStop hooks.
                  If left undefined, the controller will wait indefinitely for pods to be drained.

                          daemonsets to allow initialization and enforce startup ordering.  StartupTaints are ignored for provisioning

                          This field is intended to be used by cluster administrators to enforce that nodes can be cycled within a given time period.
                          When set, drifted nodes will begin draining even if there are pods blocking eviction. Draining will respect PDBs and the do-not-disrupt annotation until the TGP is reached.

                          Karpenter will preemptively delete pods so their terminationGracePeriodSeconds align with the node's terminationGracePeriod.
                          If a pod would be terminated without being granted its full terminationGracePeriodSeconds prior to the node timeout,
                          that pod will be deleted at T = node timeout - pod terminationGracePeriodSeconds.

                          The feature can also be used to allow maximum time limits for long-running jobs which can delay node termination with preStop hooks.
                          If left undefined, the controller will wait indefinitely for pods to be drained.
