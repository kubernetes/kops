                        Client affinity gives you control over whether to always route each client to the same specific endpoint.
                        AWS Global Accelerator uses a consistent-flow hashing algorithm to choose the optimal endpoint for a connection.
                        If client affinity is NONE, Global Accelerator uses the "five-tuple" (5-tuple) properties—source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol—to select the hash value, and then chooses the best endpoint.
                        However, with this setting, if someone uses different ports to connect to Global Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to the same endpoint because the hash value changes.
                        If you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client affinity to SOURCE_IP instead.
                        When you use the SOURCE_IP setting, Global Accelerator uses the "two-tuple" (2-tuple) properties— source (client) IP address and destination IP address—to select the hash value.
                        The default value is NONE.

                                    Weight is the weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you configure Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you specify.
                                    For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint,
                                    5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint.

                                For example, you can create a port override in which the listener receives user traffic on ports 80 and 443,
                                but your accelerator routes that traffic to ports 1080 and 1443, respectively, on the endpoints.
