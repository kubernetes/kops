	//   - For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of distributionDomainName . This
	//   is the name of the associated CloudFront distribution, such as
	//   da1b2c3d4e5.cloudfront.net .
	// The name of the record that you're creating must match a custom domain name for
	// your API, such as api.example.com . Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC
	// endpoint Enter the API endpoint for the interface endpoint, such as
	// vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticloadbalancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com
	// . For edge-optimized APIs, this is the domain name for the corresponding
	// CloudFront distribution. You can get the value of DnsName using the CLI command
	// describe-vpc-endpoints (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoints.html)
	// . CloudFront distribution Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when
	// you created your distribution. Your CloudFront distribution must include an
	// alternate domain name that matches the name of the resource record set. For
	// example, if the name of the resource record set is acme.example.com, your
	// CloudFront distribution must include acme.example.com as one of the alternate
	// domain names. For more information, see Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs) (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html)
	// in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide. You can't create a resource record set
	// in a private hosted zone to route traffic to a CloudFront distribution. For
	// failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the
	// primary and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain
	// name that matches the name of the record. However, the primary and secondary
	// records have the same name, and you can't include the same alternate domain name
	// in more than one distribution. Elastic Beanstalk environment If the domain name
	// for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you deployed the
	// environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the
	// environment. For example, the domain name
	// my-environment.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com is a regionalized domain name. For
	// environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't
	// include the region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a
	// CNAME record instead of an alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME
	// record for the root domain name. For example, if your domain name is
	// example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic for acme.example.com to
	// your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record that routes
	// traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment. For Elastic
	// Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the CNAME
	// attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the
	// value of the CNAME attribute:
	//   - Amazon Web Services Management Console: For information about how to get
	//   the value by using the console, see Using Custom Domains with Elastic
	//   Beanstalk (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html)
	//   in the Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide.
	//   - Elastic Beanstalk API: Use the DescribeEnvironments action to get the value
	//   of the CNAME attribute. For more information, see DescribeEnvironments (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/API_DescribeEnvironments.html)
	//   in the Elastic Beanstalk API Reference.
	//   - CLI: Use the describe-environments command to get the value of the CNAME
	//   attribute. For more information, see describe-environments (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elasticbeanstalk/describe-environments.html)
	//   in the CLI Command Reference.
	// ELB load balancer Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load
	// balancer. Get the DNS name by using the Amazon Web Services Management Console,
	// the ELB API, or the CLI.
	//   - Amazon Web Services Management Console: Go to the EC2 page, choose Load
	//   Balancers in the navigation pane, choose the load balancer, choose the
	//   Description tab, and get the value of the DNS name field. If you're routing
	//   traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the value that begins with dualstack. If
	//   you're routing traffic to another type of load balancer, get the value that
	//   applies to the record type, A or AAAA.
	//   - Elastic Load Balancing API: Use DescribeLoadBalancers to get the value of
	//   DNSName . For more information, see the applicable guide:
	//   - Classic Load Balancers: DescribeLoadBalancers (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/2012-06-01/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html)
	//   - Application and Network Load Balancers: DescribeLoadBalancers (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html)

	// Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website Specify the domain name
	// of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you created the bucket in, for example,
	// s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com . For more information about valid values,
	// see the table Amazon S3 Website Endpoints (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html#s3_website_region_endpoints)

	// in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. Another Route 53 resource record set
	// Specify the value of the Name element for a resource record set in the current
	// hosted zone. If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the
	// hosted zone (known as the zone apex), you can't specify the domain name for a
	// record for which the value of Type is CNAME . This is because the alias record
	// must have the same type as the record that you're routing traffic to, and
	// creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported even for an alias
	// record.
	//
	// This member is required.
	DNSName *string

	// Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency alias, and
	// weighted alias resource record sets: When EvaluateTargetHealth is true , an
	// alias resource record set inherits the health of the referenced Amazon Web
	// Services resource, such as an ELB load balancer or another resource record set
	// in the hosted zone. Note the following: CloudFront distributions You can't set
	// EvaluateTargetHealth to true when the alias target is a CloudFront
	// distribution. Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains
	// If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in DNSName and the environment
	// contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the
	// healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An
	// environment automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than
	// one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true and either no
	// Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route
	// 53 routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if any. If the
	// environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special
	// requirements. ELB load balancers Health checking behavior depends on the type of
	// load balancer:
	//   - Classic Load Balancers: If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in
	//   DNSName , Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2
	//   instances that are registered with the load balancer. If you set
	//   EvaluateTargetHealth to true and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the
	//   load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other resources.
	//   - Application and Network Load Balancers: If you specify an ELB Application
	//   or Network Load Balancer and you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true , Route 53
	//   routes queries to the load balancer based on the health of the target groups
	//   that are associated with the load balancer:
	//   - For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every
	//   target group that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If
	//   any target group contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is
	//   considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries to other resources.
	//   - A target group that has no registered targets is considered unhealthy.
	// When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load
	// Balancing health checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a
	// similar function. Do not create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances
	// that you register with an ELB load balancer. S3 buckets There are no special
	// requirements for setting EvaluateTargetHealth to true when the alias target is
	// an S3 bucket. Other records in the same hosted zone If the Amazon Web Services
	// resource that you specify in DNSName is a record or a group of records (for
	// example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we
	// recommend that you associate a health check with all of the records in the alias
	// target. For more information, see What Happens When You Omit Health Checks? (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-complex-configs.html#dns-failover-complex-configs-hc-omitting)
	// in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. For more information and examples, see

	FailureThreshold *int32

	// Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for IPAddress .
	// If you specify a value for IPAddress : Amazon Route 53 sends health check
	// requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of
	// FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header for all health checks except TCP
	// health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on
	// which you want Route 53 to perform health checks. When Route 53 checks the
	// health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the Host header:
	//   - If you specify a value of 80 for Port and HTTP or HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type ,
	//   Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the
	//   Host header.
	//   - If you specify a value of 443 for Port and HTTPS or HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type
	//   , Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the
	//   Host header.
	//   - If you specify another value for Port and any value except TCP for Type ,
	//   Route 53 passes FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port to the endpoint in the Host
	//   header.
	// If you don't specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName , Route 53 substitutes
	// the value of IPAddress in the Host header in each of the preceding cases. If
	// you don't specify a value for IPAddress : Route 53 sends a DNS request to the
	// domain that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you
	// specify for RequestInterval . Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Route 53
	// then checks the health of the endpoint. If you don't specify a value for
	// IPAddress , Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If
	// there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify
	// for FullyQualifiedDomainName , the health check fails with a "DNS resolution
	// failed" error. If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover
	// resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by
	// FullyQualifiedDomainName , we recommend that you create a separate health check
	// for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that
	// is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
	// FullyQualifiedDomainName , specify the domain name of the server (such as
	// us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets
	// (www.example.com). In this configuration, if you create a health check for which
	// the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record
	// sets and you then associate the health check with those resource record sets,
	// health check results will be unpredictable. In addition, if the value that you
	// specify for Type is HTTP , HTTPS , HTTP_STR_MATCH , or HTTPS_STR_MATCH , Route
	// 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as it does
	// when you specify a value for IPAddress . If the value of Type is TCP , Route 53
	// doesn't pass a Host header.
	FullyQualifiedDomainName *string

	// The number of child health checks that are associated with a CALCULATED health

	// element. Note the following:
	//   - If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks,

	//   - If you specify 0 , Route 53 always considers this health check to be
	//   healthy.
	HealthThreshold *int32

	// The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to
	// perform health checks on. If you don't specify a value for IPAddress , Route 53
	// sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name that you specify in
	// FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify in RequestInterval .
	// Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the
	// endpoint. Use one of the following formats for the value of IPAddress :
	//   - IPv4 address: four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for
	//   example, 192.0.2.44 .
	//   - IPv6 address: eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons
	//   (:), for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345 . You can also
	//   shorten IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example,
	//   2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345 .
	// If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP
	// address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address
	// for IPAddress . This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never
	// change. For more information, see FullyQualifiedDomainName (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateHealthCheck.html#Route53-UpdateHealthCheck-request-FullyQualifiedDomainName)

	//   - When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the secondary

	// Geolocation resource record sets only: A complex type that lets you control how
	// Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries based on the geographic origin of the
	// query. For example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web
	// server with an IP address of 192.0.2.111 , create a resource record set with a
	// Type of A and a ContinentCode of AF . If you create separate resource record
	// sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one resource record set
	// for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes to
	// the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a
	// continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent
	// to a different resource. You can't create two geolocation resource record sets
	// that specify the same geographic location. The value * in the CountryCode
	// element matches all geographic locations that aren't specified in other
	// geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type
	// elements. Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some
	// IP addresses aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create
	// geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Route 53 will
	// receive some DNS queries from locations that it can't identify. We recommend
	// that you create a resource record set for which the value of CountryCode is * .
	// Two groups of queries are routed to the resource that you specify in this
	// record: queries that come from locations for which you haven't created
	// geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't
	// mapped to a location. If you don't create a * resource record set, Route 53
	// returns a "no answer" response for queries from those locations. You can't
	// create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the
	// Name and Type elements as geolocation resource record sets.

	// If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to a
	// DNS query only when the status of a health check is healthy, include the
	// HealthCheckId element and specify the ID of the applicable health check. Route
	// 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the
	// following:
	//   - By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the
	//   health check
	//   - By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated
	//   health checks)
	//   - By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric
	//   health checks)
	// Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint that is specified in the
	// resource record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in
	// the Value element. When you add a HealthCheckId element to a resource record
	// set, Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health
	// check. For more information, see the following topics in the Amazon Route 53
	// Developer Guide:
	//   - How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-determining-health-of-endpoints.html)
	//   - Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html)
	//   - Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-private-hosted-zones.html)
	// When to Specify HealthCheckId Specifying a value for HealthCheckId is useful
	// only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to
	// respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the
	// status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the
	// following configurations:
	//   - Non-alias resource record sets: You're checking the health of a group of
	//   non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type
	//   (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and
	//   you specify health check IDs for all the resource record sets. If the health
	//   check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record
	//   among the records that it responds to DNS queries with. If the health check
	//   status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS
	//   queries using the value for that resource record set. If the health check status
	//   for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all
	//   resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries
	//   accordingly.
	//   - Alias resource record sets: You specify the following settings:
	//   - You set EvaluateTargetHealth to true for an alias resource record set in a
	//   group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type
	//   (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).
	//   - You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias
	//   resource record set in the same hosted zone.
	//   - You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set. If the
	//   health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set
	//   to be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds
	//   to DNS queries with. If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops
	//   responding to DNS queries using the alias resource record set. The alias
	//   resource record set can also route traffic to a group of non-alias resource
	//   record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that
	//   configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in
	//   the group of non-alias resource record sets.
	// Geolocation Routing For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is
	// unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated
	// geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a
	// state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and
	// a resource record set that has * for CountryCode is * , which applies to all
	// locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route
	// 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds
	// a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:
	//   - The United States
	//   - North America
	//   - The default resource record set
	// Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name If your health checks
	// specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a
	// separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for
	// each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com . For the value of
	// FullyQualifiedDomainName , specify the domain name of the server (such as
	// us-east-2-www.example.com ), not the name of the resource record sets (
	// www.example.com ). Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the
	// following:
	//   - Create a health check that has the same value for FullyQualifiedDomainName
	//   as the name of a resource record set.
	//   - Associate that health check with the resource record set.
	HealthCheckId *string

	// Multivalue answer resource record sets only: To route traffic approximately
	// randomly to multiple resources, such as web servers, create one multivalue
	// answer record for each resource and specify true for MultiValueAnswer . Note the
	// following:
	//   - If you associate a health check with a multivalue answer resource record
	//   set, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the corresponding IP address
	//   only when the health check is healthy.
	//   - If you don't associate a health check with a multivalue answer record,
	//   Route 53 always considers the record to be healthy.
	//   - Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records; if you
	//   have eight or fewer healthy records, Route 53 responds to all DNS queries with
	//   all the healthy records.
	//   - If you have more than eight healthy records, Route 53 responds to different
	//   DNS resolvers with different combinations of healthy records.
	//   - When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to
	//   eight unhealthy records.
	//   - If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a response,
	//   client software typically tries another of the IP addresses in the response.
	// You can't create multivalue answer alias records.
