// Package elasticloadbalancingv2 provides the API client, operations, and
// parameter types for Elastic Load Balancing.
//
// Elastic Load Balancing A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across
// targets, such as your EC2 instances. This enables you to increase the
// availability of your application. The load balancer also monitors the health of
// its registered targets and ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy
// targets. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by
// specifying one or more listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port
// number for connections from clients to the load balancer. You configure a target
// group with a protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer to
// the targets, and with health check settings to be used when checking the health
// status of the targets. Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of
// load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Gateway Load
// Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. This reference covers the following load
// balancer types:
//   - Application Load Balancer - Operates at the application layer (layer 7) and
//     supports HTTP and HTTPS.
//   - Network Load Balancer - Operates at the transport layer (layer 4) and
//     supports TCP, TLS, and UDP.
//   - Gateway Load Balancer - Operates at the network layer (layer 3).
//
// For more information, see the Elastic Load Balancing User Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/)
// . All Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent, which means that they
// complete at most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds.
