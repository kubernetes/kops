# Getting started (using v0.1-alpha.6)

This document covers building an apiserver from scratch using `apiserver-boot`.  It
is focused on how to use the most basic aspects of the tooling.

For information on the libraries, see the [libraries user guide](libraries_user_guide.md)

New server workflow:

- Bootstrapping your go dependencies
- Initialize your project directory structure and go packages
- Create an API group, version, resource
- Build the apiserver command
- Write an automated test for the API resource
- Run locally
- Run in cluster
- Build documentation

## Download the latest release

Make sure you downloaded and installed the latest release as described
[here](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/apiserver-builder/blob/master/docs/installing.md)

## Create your Go project

Create a Go project under GOPATH/src/

For example

> GOPATH/src/github.com/my-org/my-project

## Create a copyright header

Create a file called `boilerplate.go.txt`.  This file will contain the
copyright boilerplate appearing at the top of all generated files.

Under GOPATH/src/github.com/my-org/my-project:

- `boilerplate.go.txt`

e.g.

```go

```

## Initialize your project

This will setup the initial file structure for your apiserver, including
vendored go libraries pinned to a set of versions tested and known
to work together.  Vendored libraries are distributed with the apiserver-builder
binary tar and copied from the installation directory.

Flags:

- your-domain: unique namespace for your API groups

At the root of your go package under your GOPATH run the following command:

```sh
apiserver-boot init repo --domain <your-domain>
```

**Note:** You can skip vendoring by running with `--install-deps=false`, and install
the vendored deps separately with `apiserver-boot init glide`.  To install dependencies
using glide instead of using the bundled vendor, supply the `--fetch` flag.

## Create an API resource

An API resource provides REST endpoints for CRUD operations on a resource
type.  This is what will be used by clients to read and store instances
of the resource kind.

API resources are defined by a group (like a package), a version (v1alpha1, v1beta1, v1), and a Kind (the type)
Running the `apiserver-boot create group version resource` command will create the api group, version and Kind for you.

Files created under GOPATH/src/github.com/my-org/my-project:

- `pkg/apis/your-group/your-version/your-kind_types.go`
  - See the [libraries user guide](libraries_user_guide.md) for addtional information
- `pkg/apis/your-group/your-version/your-kind_types_test.go`
  - type integration test - basic storage read / write test
- `pkg/controller/your-kind/controller.go`
  - controller implementation - empty control loop created
- `pkg/controller/your-kind/controller-test.go`
  - controller integration test - basic control loop runs on create test
- `docs/examples/your-kind/your-kind.yaml`
  - example to show in the reference documentation - empty example
- `samples/your-kind.yaml`
  - sample config for testing your resource in your cluster - empty sample

Flags:

- your-group: name of the API group e.g. `batch`
- your-version: name of the API version e.g. `v1beta1` or `v1`
- your-kind: **Upper CamelCase** name of the type e.g. `MyKind`

At the root of your go package under your GOPATH run the following command:

```sh
apiserver-boot create group version resource --group <your-group> --version <your-version> --kind <your-kind>
```

**Note:** The resource name is the lowercase pluralization of the kind e.g. `mykinds` and
generated by default.  To directly control the name of the resource, use the `--resource` flag.

**Note:** If desired, the api group and version maybe created as separate steps with
`apiserver-boot create group` and `apiserver-boot create group version`.


## Run the apiserver + controller-manager locally

Run an etcd instance and the apiserver + controller-manager.

**Note:** This will automatically run the code generators and build the
executables.  These maybe run separate using `apiserver-boot build generated`
or `apiserver-boot build executables`.  It is possible to skip building as part of run
if the binaries have already been built and are present by using the flag `--built=false`.

**Note: that the generators must be rerun any time fields are added or removed from your resources**

**Note:** must have etcd on your PATH

```sh
apiserver-boot run local
```

Test with kubectl

```sh
kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig api-versions
```

Create an instance of your API

```sh
kubectl --kubeconfig kubeconfig create -f sample/<type>.yaml
```

More information available [here](running_locally.md)

## Run the tests

A placeholder test was created for your resource.  The test will
start your apiserver in memory, and allow you to create, read, and write
your resource types.

This is a good way to test validation and defaulting of your types.

```sh
go test ./pkg/...
```

## Run the apiserver + controller-manager with minikube

See [running in minikube](running_in_minikube.md)


## Run the apiserver + controller-manager in a cluster

Run an etcd instance and the apiserver + controller-manager as an aggregated
service inside an existing cluster.

**Note:** must have kubectl and docker on your PATH

```sh
apiserver-boot run in-cluster --name nameofservicetorun --namespace default --image gcr.io/myrepo/myimage:mytag 
```

Clear the discovery cache and test with kubectl.

```sh
rm -rf ~/.kube/cache/discovery/
kubectl api-versions
```

Create an instance of your API

```sh
kubectl create -f sample/<type>.yaml
```

More information available [here](running_in_cluster.md)

## Building and editing documentation

Build the reference documentation for your API.  This requires that the
executables have already been built so that the openapi can be
fetched from a server.

```sh
apiserver-boot build executables
apiserver-boot build docs
```

Documentation will appear in `docs/build/index.html`.

**Note**: The examples and group documentation can be modified by editing 
`docs/examples/<type>/<type>.yaml` and `docs/static_includes/_<group>.md`
respectively.
