                  A total of 100 rules will be allowed in each ANP instance.
                  The relative precedence of egress rules within a single ANP object (all of
                  which share the priority) will be determined by the order in which the rule
                  is written. Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the egress rules
                  would take the highest precedence.
                  ANPs with no egress rules do not affect egress traffic.

                                DomainName describes one or more domain names to be used as a peer.

                                DomainName can be an exact match, or use the wildcard specifier '*' to match
                                one or more labels.

                                '*', the wildcard specifier, matches one or more entire labels. It does not
                                support partial matches. '*' may only be specified as a prefix.

                                  - `kubernetes.io` matches only `kubernetes.io`.

                                    It does not match "www.kubernetes.io" or "kubernetes.io".
                                  - `*.kubernetes.io` matches subdomains of kubernetes.io.

                              well. So if you Allow or Deny traffic to `"0.0.0.0/0"`, that will allow
                              or deny all IPv4 pod-to-pod traffic as well. If you don't want that,
                              add a rule that Passes all pod traffic before the Networks rule.

                              Each item in Networks should be provided in the CIDR format and should be
                              IPv4 or IPv6, for example "10.0.0.0/8" or "fd00::/8".

                  would take the highest precedence.
                  ANPs with no ingress rules do not affect ingress traffic.

                  Egress is the list of Egress rules to be applied to the selected pods if
                  they are not matched by any AdminNetworkPolicy or NetworkPolicy rules.
                  A total of 100 Egress rules will be allowed in each BANP instance.
                  The relative precedence of egress rules within a single BANP object
                  will be determined by the order in which the rule is written.
                  Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the egress rules
                  would take the highest precedence.
                  BANPs with no egress rules do not affect egress traffic.

                              well. So if you Allow or Deny traffic to `"0.0.0.0/0"`, that will allow
                              or deny all IPv4 pod-to-pod traffic as well. If you don't want that,
                              add a rule that Passes all pod traffic before the Networks rule.

                              Each item in Networks should be provided in the CIDR format and should be

                              the cluster (based on the node's labels). It selects
                              the nodeIPs as the peer type by matching on the IPs
                              present in the node.Status.Addresses field of the node.
                              This field follows standard label selector
                              semantics; if present but empty, it selects all Nodes.

                        Ports allows for matching traffic based on port and protocols.
                        This field is a list of ports which should be matched on
                        the pods selected for this policy i.e the subject of the policy.
                        So it matches on the destination port for the ingress traffic.
                        If Ports is not set then the rule does not filter traffic via port.

                              matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels
                              map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the
                              operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
