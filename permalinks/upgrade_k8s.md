# Kubernetes Upgrade Recommended

Kops has established a deprecation policy for Kubernetes version support.
Kops will drop support for Kubernetes versions as follows:

| kops version | Drops support for Kubernetes version |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1.18         | 1.8 and below                        |
| 1.19         | 1.9 and 1.10                         |


You are running a version of kubernetes that we recommend upgrading.
